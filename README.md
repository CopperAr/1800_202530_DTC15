# Hangout

## Overview

Hangout is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps users discover and explore social hangouts or hiking trails. The app displays a curated list of hangout locations, each with details such as name, location, difficulty, and image. Users can browse the list and mark their favorite spots for easy access later.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.
